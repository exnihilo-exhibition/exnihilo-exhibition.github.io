<!--      EX NIHILO is a virtual art gallery for young artists from all over the world to showcase their-->
<!--      [multidisciplinary] work. There are no restrictions in terms of medium - all art is welcome, whether it is visual-->
<!--      art, writing, music, film and more - we want it all, so surprise us! This online exhibition is submission based &-->
<!--      guidelines will be posted soon.<br><br>-->

<!--      In the light of the current situation, while galleries and museums have closed their doors to the public,-->
<!--      countries are in lockdown and people are leading abnormal lives, EX NIHILO seeks to use this prolonged moment of-->
<!--      stillness to exhibit work by young artists in a virtual 3D space. This is an opportunity for people creating work-->
<!--      (whether it was made during or before isolation) to reach a wider audience.-->
