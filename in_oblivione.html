  <h2>A note from the curator</h2>
  <p>
    As the country came to a standstill, a few weeks into the first UK lockdown I started to become slightly more
    accustomed to the strangeness and uncertainty of the pandemic. We suddenly had so much precious time and space, and
    as a result I began to spend more energy in creative pursuits. I was soon aware that I was not the only one spending
    time trying to get inspiration: many of my friends were posting beautiful paintings, drawings, designs, songs, poems
    and more on their feeds.<br><br>

    Yet this burst in creativity was accompanied by a simultaneous set of problems created by the very same isolation –
    the difficulty to sustain momentum, to remain motivated, and the lack of physical opportunities to come together,
    display work, share and feed off each others’ energy and talent.<br><br>

    The virtual exhibition IN OBLIVIONE – the title is Latin for ‘in oblivion’ – aims to subvert this. It seeks to
    provide an online space to promote young artists from all over the world and showcase their [multidisciplinary]
    work. By providing young artists with inspiration, something to work for and a platform, it has hopefully helped
    them to find light and meaning in these dark, uncertain times.
